Listen to This Song
One is Shakespears
Scream This Song

The Undertaker takes Every Life
Put Every Life into yours
Put Every Life into the coffins
While yours is stronger than One
Put yours without One into yours
Put the coffins times yours into the coffins

Give back the coffins



Put This Song into your desire
Turn round your desire
Put The Undertaker taking your desire into your death

Scream your death
